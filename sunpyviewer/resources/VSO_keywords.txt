# this file serves as an attempt to store all of the keywords used by VSO
# in one central location to make it easier for User Interfaces to reload,
# rather than having to hard code everything
#
# each line is tab seperated, with the following fields:
# TYPE	KEYWORD	VALUE
#
# The first line that's not a comment or blank line must be 'VERSION' and
# a number.  If it changes, you should get a human to re-read the header
# file, as something significant has changed
#
# The last non-blank line must be 'END' all on its own.  if it's not,
# the file is incomplete.
#
# (yes, yes, I could've used XML... but this is easier for me to read -Joe)
#
# last updated : 2005/05/18

# in theory, we can use this partially for internationalization on some parts.
# (we'd still have to rework all of the other text in the GUIs)

# PS.  this file is UTF-8 (w/o BOM)

KEYWORD_LONG	STATUS	This list gives a short message about the overall intent of the various numerical parts of the status codes.  VSO programmers are suggested to refer to the list or KEYWORD_LONG to find an approriate status code to return for a given problem.
KEYWORD_LONG	STATUS_LONG	This list gives a more detailed message about the intent of the various VSO status codes.  Please see the API documentation for an explaination of the format of a VSO status message.
KEYWORD_LONG	STATUS_TYPE	This list provides information to determine which component of VSO generated a status message, to aid in tracking down errors generated.
KEYWORD_LONG	INFO	This list provides a description of the various types of information that a Data Provider may require to complete a GetData request.  Data Providers should refer to this list to ensure that they are using the keywords in a manner consistent with their intent.  User Interface programmers can use this list to generate more informative prompts.
KEYWORD_LONG	METHOD_PREFIX	This list provides the list of data transfer methods recognized by VSO.  If a Data Provider has a transfer method that does not fit into one of these categories, please contact the VSO Project maintainers.  User Interface programmers can use this list to generate more informative prompts.  Please see the VSO API documentation for more information about the format of data transfer methods.
KEYWORD_LONG	METHOD_SUFFIX	This list provides additional qualifiers to the data transfer methods recognized by VSO.  If a Data Provider needs to add more details to describe their data transfer methods, please contact the VSO Project maintainers.  User Interface programmers can use this list to generate more informative prompts.  Please see the VSO API documentation for more information about the format of data transfer methods.

HELP	SORT	Sort and Rearrange	<p>The Sort and Rearrange box allows you to organize the data in some manner other than the default views.</p><p>The option 'sort' will sort the records returned by VSO, represented by rows in the table.</p><p>The option 'rearrange' will change the order of the fields, represented by columns in the table.</p>
HELP	VIEWS	Views	<p>The Views box allows you to quickly switch between a prefined set of columns</p><p>The 'Basic' view will display fields that the VSO maintainers believe are useful to a wide segment of the community to filter the results from VSO.</p><p>The 'Thumbs' view will display a small image containing quicklook data to assist researchers in filtering their results.</p><p>The 'Links' view provides a clickable URL to retrieve the individual data sets, should one be available.</p><p>The 'Long' view displays everything that is defined in the VSO Data Model, and is currently being returned from the providers.</p>
HELP	COMMENTS	Comments vs. Help us improve	<p>Many people have asked about two links at the bottom of most VSO web pages.</p><p>'Comments?' can be used to give general/complaints/etc.</p><p>'Help us improve VSO' links to a voluntary questionaire about what the users would like to see implemented in VSO.</p>
HELP	CHECKBOX	CheckBox Tools	<p>The 'CheckBox Tools' box provides options to allow you to quickly select multiple congruent record sets.</p><p>You can click the 'Select All' button, if you wish to pare down the list, as opposed to selecting every record that you wish to get.</p><p>'All Above this box' and 'All Below this box' will cause all boxes above or below the checkbox (along with that checkbox that you clicked on) to be selected or deselected.  This allows you to select a range by using 'All Below this box', then clicking the first record you want, and the record one after the last one you want.</p>
HELP	RETURNED	Rows Returned	<p>The Rows Returned box contains information about the responses from the VSO Data Providers that were queried.</p><p>Data Providers may place an limit on the number of records returned in a single query.</p><p>This will keep the user from waiting for the results of a search that matched more than was suitable for that Data Provider.  (eg, a year's worth of data is suitable for an instrument that has one data product per day, but it could result in an instrument that generates a products at a higher cadence, such as once per minute.)</p>
HELP	NEWSEARCH	New Search	<p>This link will take you back to the search form.</p>
HELP	NEWTIMESEARCH	New Time Search	<p>This link will allow you to specify a new time range, while keeping the other search parameters unchanged.</p>
HELP	EDITQUERY	Edit Query	<p>This link will take you back to the original search form, re-populated with the search terms that were used, so that you may adjust them.</p>
HELP	STATUS	Search Status	<p>This box contains any error messages that were returned from the VSO, or individual VSO Data Providers.</p>
HELP	JAVASCRIPT	JavaScript	<p>Some features may require the use of JavaScript.</p><p>We have attempted to ensure that the VSO web-based interface is useable without the use of JavaScript.</p><p>If you experience something that would make you believe otherwise, please let us know by following the 'Comments?' link at the bottom of the page.</p>
HELP	TIMESELECT	Time Selection	<p>If you have JavaScript enabled, it will ensure that you do not set the start time after the end time.</p><p><b>Tip:</b> Because of this, you can save time by moving the start time if you want to increase a number, and the end time if you want to decrease a number.</p>
